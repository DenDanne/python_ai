In a galaxy not so far away, nestled within the misty forests of Dagobah, lies Yoda’s Galactic Cantina—a humble yet mystical sanctuary where Jedi, 
smugglers, and adventurers gather to indulge in the finest intergalactic cuisine. 
The dimly lit interior flickers with the glow of floating lanterns, casting shadows that dance like the stars above. Wooden tables carved from ancient swamp trees line the room, 
and the scent of exotic spices mingles with the earthy aroma of the surrounding marshes.
As you enter, a small, cloaked figure greets you from behind the bar. "Hungry, you are. Feed you, we will," 
he murmurs with a sly smile before disappearing into the kitchen. The air hums faintly, as if the Force itself flows through the room, guiding your senses toward a menu like no other.

 --- Yoda’s Galactic Menu --- 

 * Forceful Stew: A rich, slow-cooked broth made with Dagobah swamp roots, roasted fungi, and tender nerf meat. Rumored to restore vitality and sharpen reflexes.

 * Wisdom Greens Salad: Fresh alien greens tossed with glowing lumina berries, drizzled with a tangy dressing harvested from Endor’s moon. Crunchy, vibrant, and refreshing.

 * Starfire Skewers: Grilled womp rat skewers marinated in Tatooine spice blends, served with a side of crispy bantha fries.

 * Mystic Noodles: Twisted noodles soaked in a savory broth of Krayt dragon bone stock, topped with diced mynock meat and garnished with a sprinkle of kyber dust for a hint of cosmic flavor.

 * Blue Milk Delight: A creamy dessert made from Bantha milk custard, served with candied space pearls and a hint of cinnamon dust.

 * (VEGAN OPTION) Green Creamy Grass: A soup with creamy grass.

As you savor the last bite, Yoda shuffles by, offering a cryptic word of advice: “Eat well, you must, for the battles ahead.
